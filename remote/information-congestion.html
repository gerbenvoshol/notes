Rather than looking up everything, you should learn a small amount of things by hand so that you can use them without having to look them up. This is also known as 'knowing'.</p><p>Sadly, you just can't know everything. At any one time, a single person can only 'know' so much about a subject. Large amounts of information read in books will be forgotten given due time, simply due to the fact that the information is not useful.</p><p>However, by writing down the things that I believe will be useful for me in the future using bite-sized pieces of meaningful information, I hope to create a searchable database of knowledge that is directly understandable by the future me.</p><p>This is efficient because look-up time is minimal, and the information is written in my own 'language', meaning that it will be easier for me to re-learn the knowledge once I read what I have written in <a href='this-note-taking-system.html'>this note-taking system</a>.</p></main></body></html>
