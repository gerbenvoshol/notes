The strength of opponents in the game, and the structure of the world, et cetera, all needs to make sense in a video game. If the player character suddenly falls through the floor at a certain spot and dies, suspension of disbelief is broken.</p><p><a href='exposure.html'>Exposure</a> in a video game means not only trying to deliver information in a way so that the player remembers it, but also keeping the player's sense of control while doing so. One way to solve this is to have the player listen to exposure while simultaneously playing the game, as is done in Portal, Thomas Was Alone, The Stanley Parable and The Witness.</p><p>Many games choose to keep the exposure optional, through NPC dialogue or readable notes. However, most games have some sort of minimal exposure that is not optional, but tries to hinder the gameplay as little as possible. Hindering the gameplay too much results in the player growing impatient in a way that a listener to a traditional story (i.e. watching a movie, reading a book) never would.</p></main></body></html>
