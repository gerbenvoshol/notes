title: This note-taking system
tags: monologue,philosophy
public: yes

This note-taking system was inspired by the [Zettelk√§sten](zettelkasten.html) method. It allows brief pieces of information to be interlinked using HTML's hyperlinks.

The basis of this note-taking system is convenience. Several tools lend to the convenience of taking notes.

* The C programming language allows for defining powerful programs that do File Input-Output, writing parts of the documents for me, and automatically generating an index.
* The [MD4C](https://github.com/mity/md4c) Markdown parser provides a quick and accessible interface to writing custom renderers for the [markdown format](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
* HTML and CSS enable endless ways to present information.
* Tools like PowerShell Core and GNU let me list and sort files and automate the build process.

The philosophy behind this note-taking system is to alleviate [information congestion](information-congestion.html) and make it easier for me to remember things that I have once known, but forgotten.
